# Movie Recommendation System
 
This project endeavors to review movie recommendation systems regarding their respective approaches, efficiencies, and limitations. A content-based movie recommendation system was
developed based on the TMDb dataset of 5000 movies. Recommendations are to be provided bythe system for films according to genres, cast, crew, and keywords attributes using cosine
s imilarity in order to generate the recommendations. Later on, this was integrated with the TMDb
API for fetching movie posters to enrich the user experience with both visual and textual
recommendations. Streamlit was used for deployment, which made an interactive web interface
through which the user selects a movie and presents real-time recommendations.
Although this project has many limitations, it provides a very good starting point for projects in
the development of intelligent recommendation systems. The methods here can be relatively easily
extended beyond films for serving e-commerce, music streaming, or educational content delivery.
This system is efficient in data handling and is user-friendly in design, thus providing valuable
insights into the content-driven recommendation engines.
